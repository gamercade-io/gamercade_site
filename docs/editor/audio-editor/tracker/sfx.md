The Sfx Editor is responsible for defining sound effects for your game. A sound effect is simply composed of a single chain, and a speed at which it should be played.

The chain index can be adjusted by moving the slider to the desired index.

The speed (in bpm) can be adjusted by moving the slider to the desired rate.
