# Graphics Editor

The Graphics Editor is used for editing all graphical aspects of Gamercade ROMs. This include colors via palettes, and images via sprites and sprite sheets.

## Navigating the Graphics Editor

The graphics editor has three modes:

- *Palettes* - For editing palettes and the colors in them.
- *Sprite Sheets* - For editing sprite sheets, a series of of grouped sprites.
- *Sprite Editor* - For editing individual sprite images.

You can navigate between different graphics editor modes by clicking the desired mode on the top panel of the main editor window. Note that some selections (such as preview palette, or preview sprite image) may be shared across editor views.

## Sprite Scaling

Sprite scaling adjusts the size of palettes when previewed in the Sprite Sheet Editor and Palette Editor. The scale ranges from 1.0 to 16.0.
