# Palette Editor

The Palette Editor is primarily used for defining and editing palettes to be used when drawing sprites and graphics. Each palette is composed of 64 colors, defined by standard 32-bit RGBA Values (8 bits per channel). Currently, the alpha channel can only be set to 0 (completely off), or 255 (completely on).

## Palette List

The Palette list is used for viewing and selecting palettes.

A palette can be selected by clicking its name on the list.

The palette list also houses some buttons for interacting with the list as a whole.

- *New* - Insert a new default palette.
- *Import* - Import a palette from a file.
- *Delete* - Delete the selected palette.
- *Duplicate* - Duplicate the selected palette.
- *Up* - Move the selected palette up one spot on the list.
- *Down* - Move the selected palette down one spot on the list.
