# Sprite Sheet Editor

![Sprite Sheet Editor](/img/editor/sprite-sheet-editor.png)

The Sprite Sheet Editor is primarily used for setting up and modifying collections of sprites, so that they can be drawn in-game using the `sprite` function. Each sprite sheet is a collection of sprites, all of which share the same width and height measurements. You are free to organize sprites and sprite sheets as you wish, such as by size, by character, or whatever other method which works for you

## Sprite Sheet List

The Sprite Sheet List is used for viewing and selecting sprite sheets.

A sprite sheet can be selected by clicking its name on the list.

The Sprite Sheet List also features two buttons:

- **New** - Inserts a new default sprite sheet, with a single default sprite.
- **Delete** - Deletes the selected sprite sheet.

## Sprite Sheet Settings

The Sprite Sheet Settings widget is used for adjusting general information about the sprite sheet, such as the name and dimensions of that sheet. Because these changes can have quite large effects, there is a two step process in order to commit any changes to the sprite sheet.

In order to edit the settings, first click the Edit button. Now, you are able to change the name, width, or height of the sprite sheet. If you are satisfied with your changes, click the apply button. If you wish to undo you changes, click the cancel button - this will revert things to what they were previously.

When resizing sprite sheets, pixels will be added or removed depending on if the new size is larger or smaller.
