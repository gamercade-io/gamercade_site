# Gamercade Editor

![Gamercade Editor](/img/editor/rom-editor.png)

The Editor is the primary tool for bundling assets with game code, and exporting them into the `.gcrom` file format. All Gamercade games are run and shared in this format.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
