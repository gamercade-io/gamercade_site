# Input

Each input function requires a player_id. Note that this is the player_id as determined by the console, *not* the local or networked player.

Due to WASM limitations, the return type of each function is either treated as a bool value (0 for false, or 1 for true) inside of a i32, or a f32 value for analog style controls. See each section for more details.

A `-1` or `NaN` value indicates that the passed in player id is invalid.

### Button Inputs

Each button function has three variants, `pressed`, `released`, and `held`.

`pressed` returns 1 if the button was just pressed this frame, otherwise 0.

`released` returns 1 if the button was just released this frame, otherwize 0.

`held` returns 1 if the button is held down, or 0 if the button is not pressed.

If passed in player id is invalid, these functions will return a value of `-1`.

### Analog Controls

These are not yet implemented, but are coming soon.

If passed in player id is invalid, these functions will return a NaN value.

```rust title="Analog Input Api"
// Left Stick
fn analog_left_x(player_id: i32) -> f32;
fn analog_left_y(player_id: i32) -> f32;

// Right Stick
fn analog_right_x(player_id: i32) -> f32;
fn analog_right_y(player_id: i32) -> f32;

// Analog Triggers
fn trigger_left(player_id: i32) -> f32;
fn trigger_right(player_id: i32) -> f32;
```

### (Advanced) Raw Input

TODO: Explain Raw Input Spec

```rust
// Returns the raw input state as seen directly by the console.
fn raw_input_state(played_id: i32) -> i64;
```
